# Spark-TTS-Unity

Unity package for using Spark-TTS on-device models. This is a C# port of [https://github.com/SparkAudio/Spark-TTS](https://github.com/SparkAudio/Spark-TTS) by SparkAudio team and uses converted ONNX models instead of the PyTorch models in the original repo.

## What is Spark-TTS?

Spark-TTS is an open-source text-to-speech system capable of generating high-quality, natural-sounding speech directly on your device. This Unity package makes it easy to incorporate this technology into your Unity projects.

## Key Features:

* ðŸŽ® **Unity-Native Integration**: Simple API designed specifically for Unity
* ðŸ”Š **Voice Styling**: Customize gender, pitch, and speed parameters
* ðŸŽ­ **Voice Cloning**: Clone voices from reference audio clips
* ðŸ’» **Runs Offline**: All processing happens on-device
* âš¡ **Optimized Performance**: Caching system for faster repeated generation

## Perfect For:

* Indie games with lots of dialogue
* Accessibility features
* Prototyping narrative content
* Dynamic content generation

## Usage

### Basic Voice Generation Using Styles

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using SparkTTS;
using SparkTTS.Utils;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class TTSExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    private CharacterVoice characterVoice;
    private AudioSource audioSource;

    async void Start()
    {
        // Initialize the TTS system (optional - sets log levels and optimal memory usage mode)
        CharacterVoiceFactory.Initialize(LogLevel.Warning, true); // Set OptimalMemoryUsage to true for IOS
        
        // Get reference to AudioSource
        audioSource = GetComponent<AudioSource>();
        
        // Get the singleton instance of the factory
        var voiceFactory = CharacterVoiceFactory.Instance;
        
        // Create a styled voice (gender: male/female, pitch: very_low/low/moderate/high/very_high, speed: very_low/low/moderate/high/very_high)
        characterVoice = await voiceFactory.CreateFromStyleAsync(
            gender: "female",
            pitch: "moderate", 
            speed: "moderate",
            referenceText: "Hello, I am a character voice sample."
        );
        
        // Generate and play speech
        if (characterVoice != null)
        {
            await GenerateAndPlaySpeech("Hello, welcome to my game! I'm an on-device TTS voice.");
        }
    }
    
    public async Task GenerateAndPlaySpeech(string text)
    {
        if (characterVoice == null) return;
        
        AudioClip generatedClip = await characterVoice.GenerateSpeechAsync(text);
        
        if (generatedClip != null && audioSource != null)
        {
            audioSource.clip = generatedClip;
            audioSource.Play();
        }
    }
    
    private void OnDestroy()
    {
        // Clean up resources
        characterVoice?.Dispose();
        // Note: Don't dispose the factory instance as it's a singleton
    }
}
```

### Voice Cloning from Reference Audio

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using SparkTTS;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class VoiceCloningExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    public AudioClip referenceClip; // Assign in inspector
    private CharacterVoice clonedVoice;
    private AudioSource audioSource;
    
    async void Start()
    {
        // Initialize the TTS system (optional - sets log levels)
        CharacterVoiceFactory.Initialize(DebugLogger.LogLevel.Warning);
        
        audioSource = GetComponent<AudioSource>();
        
        // Get the singleton instance of the factory
        var voiceFactory = CharacterVoiceFactory.Instance;
        
        if (referenceClip != null)
        {
            // Clone voice from reference audio (note: this is async)
            clonedVoice = await voiceFactory.CreateFromReferenceAsync(referenceClip);
            Debug.Log("Voice cloned from reference audio");
        }
    }
    
    public async void SpeakText(string text)
    {
        if (clonedVoice == null) return;
        
        AudioClip generatedClip = await clonedVoice.GenerateSpeechAsync(text);
        
        if (generatedClip != null && audioSource != null)
        {
            audioSource.clip = generatedClip;
            audioSource.Play();
        }
    }
    
    private void OnDestroy()
    {
        clonedVoice?.Dispose();
        // Note: Don't dispose the factory instance as it's a singleton
    }
}
```

## Model Deployment Tool

SparkTTS includes a built-in Editor tool that automatically copies the required models from `Assets/Models` to `StreamingAssets` with the correct precision settings.

**Access the tool**: `Window > SparkTTS > Model Deployment Tool`

### Key Features

* **Precision-Aware**: Uses optimal precision variants (FP16/FP32) for each model
* **Large Model Support**: Handles `model.onnx_data` files automatically
* **Size Optimization**: Only copies necessary models to reduce build size
* **Backup Support**: Creates backups of existing models before overwriting
* **Dry Run Mode**: Preview changes without actually copying files

### How to Use

1. **Open the tool**: Go to `Window > SparkTTS > Model Deployment Tool`
2. **Configure paths**: 
   - Source: `Assets/Models` (automatically detected)
   - Destination: `Assets/StreamingAssets/SparkTTS` (automatically configured)
3. **Select components**: 
   - âœ… **SparkTTS Models** (core voice generation models)
   - âœ… **LLM Models** (large language models for text processing)
4. **Review selection**: The tool shows exactly which models will be copied and their file sizes
5. **Deploy**: Click "Deploy SparkTTS Models" to copy the optimized model set

### Model Precision Settings

| Model | Precision | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| wav2vec2_model | FP16 | Optimized for audio processing |
| bicodec_encoder_quantizer | FP32 | Full precision for quality |
| bicodec_vocoder | FP32 | Full precision for quality |
| mel_spectrogram | FP32 | Audio feature extraction |
| speaker_encoder_tokenizer | FP32 | Speaker encoding |
| LLM model | FP32 | Large language model (includes 1.9GB data file) |

### Advanced Options

* **Overwrite Existing**: Replace existing models in StreamingAssets
* **Create Backup**: Keep .backup copies of replaced files
* **Dry Run**: Preview operations without copying files

### Integration with [LiveTalk-Unity](https://github.com/arghyasur1991/LiveTalk-Unity)

This tool can be used standalone or integrated with LiveTalk's deployment tool. When using LiveTalk, the SparkTTS models are automatically deployed through this tool's API.

## Model Setup

This package requires Spark-TTS models in the following location:

```
Assets/StreamingAssets/SparkTTS/
  â”œâ”€â”€ bicodec_encoder_quantizer.onnx
  â”œâ”€â”€ bicodec_vocoder.onnx
  â”œâ”€â”€ mel_spectrogram.onnx
  â”œâ”€â”€ speaker_encoder_tokenizer.onnx
  â”œâ”€â”€ wav2vec2_model.onnx
  â””â”€â”€ LLM/
      â”œâ”€â”€ model.onnx
      â”œâ”€â”€ model.onnx_data
      â”œâ”€â”€ config.json
      â”œâ”€â”€ generation_config.json
      â”œâ”€â”€ added_tokens.json
      â”œâ”€â”€ tokenizer.json
      â”œâ”€â”€ tokenizer_config.json
      â”œâ”€â”€ special_tokens_map.json
      â”œâ”€â”€ vocab.json
      â””â”€â”€ merges.txt
```

You can obtain these models by using the `export_sparktts_onnx.py` script from the [Spark-TTS repository](https://github.com/arghyasur1991/Spark-TTS). This script converts the original PyTorch models to ONNX format for use in Unity.

### Exporting Models

1. Clone the Spark-TTS repository: `git clone https://github.com/arghyasur1991/Spark-TTS.git`
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Run the export script: `python export_sparktts_onnx.py`
4. Copy the `SparkTTS` folder with exported ONNX models inside `onnx_models` to your Unity project's `Assets/Models` directory
5. **Use the Model Deployment Tool** (recommended): Go to `Window > SparkTTS > Model Deployment Tool` to automatically copy only the required models with optimal precision settings

### Pre-Exported ONNX Models

As an alternative to running the export script, you can download pre-exported ONNX models from this [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YXj81ApcEasY17a8Zj9RqTpvn4s1UKk7/view?usp=sharing).

1. Download the ZIP file from the link
2. Extract the contents
3. Copy the extracted `SparkTTS` folder with models to your Unity project's `Assets/Models/` directory
4. **Use the Model Deployment Tool** (recommended): Go to `Window > SparkTTS > Model Deployment Tool` to automatically copy only the required models with optimal precision settings

**Or manually copy**: Copy the `SparkTTS` folder directly to `Assets/StreamingAssets/` (includes all model variants)

## Sample Demo
